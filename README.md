# RealMedicine

RealMedicine is a mod that makes Medicine in Rimworld more realistic. If you are
a Doctor or Medic and you see that I made some horrible mistakes, please log an issue ticket.
Be aware that this mod is not for the weak hearted,

## Bleeding mechanic

This mod introduces a new bleeding mechanic what can be confusing at first.
The way I see it is that internal bleeding can not be fixed by putting a bandage
on it. You will notice this that doctors will not heal internal wounds with
normal vanilla equipment (except Glitterworld Medicine, but more on that later).

What does this mean for you? Well first of all, more micromanagement after a raid.
I know that Rimworld already has a lot of micromanagement to keep pawns alive, but ill make it a bit easier. Pawns will loose blood slower on internal body parts, so they will have more time to heal (except for the heart). Internal bleeding will also not cause blood spats.
Depending on how worse the bleeding is, in some cases they could be fine. But in most cases
they will not be fine. Also Bloodloss will replenish slower.

So how do I treat internal wounds then? First of all Tribals don't. If you play as
tribal and a raider shoots your colonist in the heart, that person 'should' die.
It is possible to fix Internal wounds with Glitterworld Medicine or with Operating tools. Operating tools need to be used by a level 5 doctor and the operation also has to be scheduled by the player (akka you).

Industrial and Spacers also get access to Blood Donation and Blood Transfusions.
It is important that Pawns have a healthy blood supply or complications could occur.
